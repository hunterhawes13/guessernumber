#Guess a number
Objective: Write a game that prompts the user to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100.

#index2.js solves the challenge using <form> & <input> & <button> tags

this was especially tricky. I solved the problem by triggering a function on click in the HTML.


### ENTER THE MATRIX WHEN GUESSED CORRECTLY
